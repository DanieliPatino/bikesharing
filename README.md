##	Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if the bike-sharing program in New York City will work in Des Moines, Iowa. 


##	Results:
Checkout Times of Users:

This graph shows that the majority of rides are 5 minutes long. Very few rides exceed an hour. Manhattan is a very vast and lively city. With that energy comes some danger. Drivers and bike messengers drive with a purpose. If you are not an experienced bike rider it might be very intimidating to drive among the experts. 
Riding in Des Moines might be a bit more mellow and riders might feel more comfortable riding for longer.
Checkout Times by Gender:

The majority of riders are male. This program could be more popular with that gender due to the difference of clothes. New York gets really warm and humid in the summer, which prompts people to wear lighter clothes like shorts or skirts. If a woman is wearing a skirt or a dress, it might be harder to ride a bike rather than someone wearing shorts.
For the Des Moines branch, we could advertise it a bit more so both genders can plan ahead to increase patrons in women.

Trips by Weekday for Each Hour:

This program is very popular with tourists and locals. From the graph it shows that a lot of locals use the bike-sharing program to commute to and from work on the weekdays. Tourists and possible locals are using it as a recreational thing to do over the weekends. 
We can advertise the bike-sharing program in Des Moines as a good way to commute to work.

Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):

More men are using the bike-sharing program to commute to work. This could be due to the dress code most offices have. It will be more difficult for women not to ruin their make-up and hair on a bike rather than other transportations. 
In Des Moines we can advertise this program more of a recreational and exercise option to lure more people that might not have the option to use that to commute. 

User Trips by Gender by Weekday:

Overall there are more subscribers using this program. Depending on the perks each subscribers gets it will be more convenient to become a subscriber rather than a “one time customer” each time you sign up. 
Depending on the day to day life of a Des Moinean, the perks might change, but it would be a good idea to make them appropriate and enticing to the people to give them more of an incentive to sign up and keep them coming.

Top Starting Location:

The majority of the starting locations are in the heart of Manhattan. Most tourists will stay inside the island of Manhattan to explore popular spots. A lot of the starting points are in or close to famous parks or tourist spots, like the Empire State Building.
In Des Moines we can provide a city map that will include popular spots people can start their journey in.

Top Ending Location:

A lot of the popular ending locations are the same as the starting locations. Most people might start in one popular location and end their journey in another.
In Des Moines we can also provide popular local restaurants where people can grab a bite to eat after riding around the town. This way we can help the local businesses.

Bike Utilization:

As you can see from the graph provided, there are some bikes that are used a lot more than others. This could be due to their location. Depending on the foot traffic, its wise to locate more bikes in more popular locations. Its also smart to rotate the less used ones with the most popular ones in either the off season or during off hours. That way specific ones do not get worn down more than others and cost us more to do maintenance on specific ones.
Once we get more information on the process in Des Moines we can determine which ones are getting used more and come up with a plan to rotate their locations.

##	Summary: 
![Start Station Name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92958939/160324789-ec2237ff-ec0c-4774-87c3-e55641cdf83a.png)
![End Station Name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92958939/160324800-12433c50-9870-4911-a1c4-10b69ce9b739.png)

I have provided these two graphs showing the most popular stations to start and end the bike-sharing. Looking at the information provided, you can see that the most popular stations are the ones located close to popular tourist locations, such as Broadway. Others include Pershing Square North which is in front of Grand Central Terminal. Also West S & Chamber St which is located close to a community college and a high school.
It would be wise to also add bikes close to high schools and college/ university in Des Moines. Looking at the data in NYC it shows it is a popular way for students to get around. 


As shows on all the graphs above, New York City’s bike-sharing program is exceeding in expectations. They have a constant users, either one time customers or subscribers, using their program. Data shows they have enough bikes to provide to their customers and are located in the right locations that have high foot traffic.
Des Moines is a growing metropolis. They not only have a beautiful city with a lot of attractions, such as an art center, sculpture park, and a botanical garden, they also have a vast amount of bike trails. Iowa was thousands of miles of paved bike trails. Due to that the city is more bike friendly than most other cities, and more of the community and possible customers will feel safer traveling in bikes. I believe with the layout of Des Moines I see the bike-sharing program being very successful in Des Moines, Iowa.
